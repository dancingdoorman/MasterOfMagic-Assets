Tauron's appearance may be a very strong reference to the antagonist chaos wizard Wagnard from the manga and 1988 OVA Record of Lodoss War. Tauron and Wagnard look almost identical to each other, with another heavily inspired Record of Lodoss War reference being Kali (who appears to be based off of another Record of Lodoss War antagonist). In the initial sketches from Master of Magic's artist George Edward Purdy, a concept portrait bearing a close likeness to Tauron was named "Nmoi, the Evil Sorcerer" (which in turn bore a resemblance to the Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy and was possibly a humorous nod to him).
