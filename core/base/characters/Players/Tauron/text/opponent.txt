Higher Difficulties subject a Wizard's default profile to increasingly arbitrary adjustments, including exposure to random Realms and skills. Tauron's Chaos ranks nearly always remain a dominant influence on his AI Personality even after these adjustments, though any randomly-picked Retorts at high Difficulty settings can sway him to roll something unexpected. At the "Impossible" setting, be prepared for anything.
