Tauron's portrait may be selected for a custom Wizard when starting a new game at any Difficulty setting above "Intro" in the official game, or respectively "Easy" in the unoficial patches. Selecting either his default profile or his portrait prevents him from being encountered as an opposing Wizard.

Played on his default spec, Tauron might want to begin by directing all his secular resources like  Gold,  Production, and Food to exploration in every direction. With a Retort that plays exactly (and exclusively) to his bookshelf, Tauron's over-the-top, lop-sided focus on raw killing power actually makes him one of the best-built default Wizards. Tauron can fight high-stakes battles and win. The problem is that he has to cast a lot of spells, consuming his economy and  Power Base. Tauron's is an exercise in accurate map assessment: deciding when to blow through  Mana, causing mayhem... and when to pull back and develop new toys for causing more mayhem.
