At the start of the game, a non-customized Tauron knows all Common Chaos spells except for Warp Wood in the official game, or Wall of Fire from the unofficial 1.40 Insecticide patch onward. A randomly generated opposing Tauron may end up with 11 Spellbooks. In this case, he will also know the Uncommon Spells Lightning Bolt and Doom Bat, as well as the Rare Spell Efreet (respectively Lightning Bolt, Chimeras, and Doom Bolt in the unofficial patches). For other book combinations, see the Wizard article.
