Tauron is one of the 14 Wizards featured in Master of Magic. By default, he has 10 Spellbooks at his disposal, as well as the Chaos Mastery Retort.

A demon of the Chaos Realm, Tauron rates himself both victim and victor in the power play that ejected him onto the cosmic backwater of Arcanus. Where his foes saw a fitting dead end, Tauron sees the future.

Here hides an opportunity to rampage across unspoiled land, drunk on domination and pyromagical thrills, ascending to the heights of power and abuse. A Spell of Mastery brought on by Tauron would crack all rules, rendering Arcanus and Myrror no mere extensions, but the true form indeed, of Chaos.
