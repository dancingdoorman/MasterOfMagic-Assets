# Introduction

From the game manual:

"Imagine falling through time and space. You land in a world called Arcanus, a world something like medieval earth, yet one where the practiced arts of alchemy and magic are true and powerful. The creatures of fantasy (Elves, Orcs, Klackons and such) that in our world have so far been dismissed as the products of fertile imagination, are reality on Arcanus. Here, these creatures are intelligent beings who, along with species unknown to Earth even in fantasy, form the myriad races that populate Arcanus.

Beyond Arcanus there lies a mysterious second world, Myrror. Accessible only through ancient Towers of Wizardry or through the careful practice of some obscure forms of magic, Myrror is in all senses an alien world full of powerful magic, danger and creatures of the most fantastic ilk. The saying among Wizards is that no one can truly rule Arcanus until they’ve cracked the Myrror.

Into these worlds you emerge as a fledgling wizard. Sparsely equipped with but a spell or two, you begin as the ruler of a tiny hamlet and its people. With these raw materials, you must build a thriving city, explore the two worlds of Arcanus and Myrror, expand your empire and learn new spells. In time, you will meet other wizards, each rising from equally humble beginnings, each having the same goal as you, namely conquering the worlds. How well you allocate resources, make use of your races’ potentials, seize opportunities and negotiate with other wizards determines your eventual success.

In the end, though, there can be only one Master of Magic!"

# Reviews
Main article: Game Magazine Coverage
Back in the old days, Master of Magic usually scored between 80% and 90% in gaming magazines. It's been praised as the possibly best strategy game at that time if it wasn't for gamebreaking bugs, low graphics and repetitive sounds.
